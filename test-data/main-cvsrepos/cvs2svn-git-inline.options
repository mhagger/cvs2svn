# This is an example of an options file that can be used to make
# cvs2svn convert to git rather than to Subversion.  See
# www/cvs2svn.html for general information, and see the comments in
# this file and in cvs2svn-example.options for information about what
# options are available and how they can be set.

# "cvs2git" is shorthand for "cvs2svn in the mode where it is
# outputting to git instead of Subversion".  But the program that
# needs to be run is still called "cvs2svn".  Run it with the
# --options option, passing it this file as argument:
#
#     cvs2svn --options=cvs2svn-git.options

# Many options are shared with Subversion, so we simply import the
# sample Subversion options file (from the current directory, which
# should be the main cvs2svn directory)...
execfile('cvs2svn-example.options')

# ...and then we overwrite the things that need to be different.

# Set this option to True to convert only the main branch of the CVS
# repository:
ctx.trunk_only = False

# cvs2git only supports single-project conversions (multiple-project
# conversions wouldn't really make sense for git anyway).  So these
# options must both be set to False:
ctx.cross_project_commits = False
ctx.cross_branch_commits = False

# Specify a username to be used for commits for which CVS doesn't
# record the original author (for example, the creation of a branch).
# This should be a simple (unix-style) username, but it can be
# translated into a git-style name by the author_transforms map.
ctx.username = 'cvs2svn'

# CVS uses unix login names as author names whereas git requires
# author names to be of the form "foo <bar>".  The default is to set
# the git author to "cvsauthor <cvsauthor>".  author_transforms can be
# used to map cvsauthor names (e.g., "jrandom") to a true name and
# email address (e.g., "J. Random <jrandom@example.com>" for the
# example shown).  All values should be either 16-bit strings (i.e.,
# with "u" as a prefix) or 8-bit strings in the utf-8 encoding.
# Please substitute your own project's usernames here to use with the
# author_transforms option of GitOutputOption below.
