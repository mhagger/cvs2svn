.SH NAME
cvs2svn \- convert a cvs repository into a subversion repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvs2svn
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIOUTPUT-OPTION CVS-REPOS-PATH\fR
.br
.B cvs2svn
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fI--options=PATH\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a new Subversion repository based on the version history stored in a
CVS repository. Each CVS commit will be mirrored in the Subversion
repository, including such information as date of commit and id of the
committer.
.P
\fICVS-REPOS-PATH\fR is the filesystem path of the part of the CVS
repository that you want to convert.  It is not possible to convert a
CVS repository to which you only have remote access; see the FAQ for
more information.  This path doesn't have to be the top level
directory of a CVS repository; it can point at a project within a
repository, in which case only that project will be converted.  This
path or one of its parent directories has to contain a subdirectory
called CVSROOT (though the CVSROOT directory can be empty).
.P
Multiple CVS repositories can be converted into a single Subversion
repository in a single run of cvs2svn, but only by using an
\fB--options\fR file.
.SH "OPTIONS FILE"
.TP
\fB--options\fR=\fIpath\fR
Read the conversion options from \fIpath\fR instead of from the
command line.  This option allows far more conversion flexibility than
can be achieved using the command-line alone.  See the documentation
for more information.  Only the following command-line options are
allowed in combination with \fB--options\fR: \fB-h\fR/\fB--help\fR,
\fB--help-passes\fR, \fB--version\fR, \fB-v\fR/\fB--verbose\fR,
\fB-q\fR/\fB--quiet\fR, \fB-p\fR/\fB--pass\fR/\fB--passes\fR,
\fB--dry-run\fR, and \fB--profile\fR.
.SH "OUTPUT OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fB--svnrepos\fR \fIpath\fR
Load CVS repository into the Subversion repository located at
\fIpath\fR.  If there is no Subversion repository at \fIpath\fR,
create a new one.
.TP
\fB--existing-svnrepos\fR
Load output into existing SVN repository, instead of creating a new
repository.  The existing repository must either be empty or contain
no paths that conflict with paths that will be output by cvs2svn.
Please note that you need write permission for the repository files.
.TP
\fB--fs-type\fR
Pass \fI--fs-type\fR=\fItype\fR to "svnadmin create" when creating a
new repository.
.TP
\fB--bdb-txn-nosync\fR
Pass \fI--bdb-txn-nosync\fR to "svnadmin create" when creating a new
BDB-style Subversion repository.
.TP
\fB--dumpfile\fR=\fIpath\fR
Just produce a dumpfile; don't commit to an SVN repository.  Write the
dumpfile to \fIpath\fR.
.TP
\fB--dry-run\fR
Do not create a repository or a dumpfile; just print the details of what
cvs2svn would do if it were really converting your repository.
.SH "CONVERSION OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--trunk-only\fR
Convert only trunk commits, not tags nor branches.
.TP
\fB--trunk\fR=\fIpath\fR
Set the top-level path to use for trunk in the Subversion repository.
The default is \fItrunk\fR.
.TP
\fB--branches\fR=\fIpath\fR
Set the top-level path to use for branches in the Subversion
repository.  The default is \fIbranches\fR.
.TP
\fB--tags\fR=\fIpath\fR
Set the top-level path to use for tags in the Subversion repository.
The default is \fItags\fR.
.TP
\fB--no-prune\fR
When all files are deleted from a directory in the Subversion
repository, don't delete the empty directory (the default is to delete
any empty directories.
.TP
\fB--encoding\fR=\fIencoding\fR
Use \fIencoding\fR as the encoding for filenames, log messages, and
author names in the CVS repos.  This option may be specified
multiple times, in which case the encodings are tried in order
until one succeeds.  Default: ascii.  See
http://docs.python.org/lib/standard-encodings.html for a list of other
standard encodings.
.TP
\fB--fallback-encoding\fR=\fIencoding\fR
If none of the encodings specified with \fB--encoding\fR succeed in
decoding an author name or log message, then fall back to using
\fIencoding\fR in lossy 'replace' mode.  Use of this option may cause
information to be lost, but at least it allows the conversion to run
to completion.  This option only affects the encoding of log messages
and author names; there is no fallback encoding for filenames.  (By
using an \fB--options\fR file, it is possible to specify a fallback
encoding for filenames.)  Default: disabled.
.TP
\fB--symbol-transform\fR=\fIpattern\fR:\fIreplacement\fR
Transform RCS/CVS symbol names before entering them into Subversion.
\fIpattern\fR is a Python regexp pattern that is matches against the
entire symbol name; \fIreplacement\fR is a replacement using Python's
regexp reference syntax.  You may specify any number of these options;
they will be applied in the order given on the command line.
.TP
\fB--symbol-hints\fR=\fIpath\fR
Read symbol conversion hints from \fIpath\fR.  The format of
\fIpath\fR is the same as the format output by
\fB--write-symbol-info\fR, namely a text file with four
whitespace-separated columns: \fIproject-id\fR, \fIsymbol\fR,
\fIconversion\fR, and \fIparent-lod-name\fR.  \fIproject-id\fR is
the numerical ID of the project to which the symbol belongs, counting
from 0.  \fIproject-id\fR can be set to '.' if project-specificity is
not needed.  \fIsymbol-name\fR is the name of the symbol being
specified.  \fIconversion\fR specifies how the symbol should be
converted, and can be one of the values 'branch', 'tag', or 'exclude'.
If \fIconversion\fR is '.', then this rule does not affect how the
symbol is converted.  \fIparent-lod-name\fR is the name of the symbol
from which this symbol should sprout, or '.trunk.' if the symbol
should sprout from trunk.  If \fIparent-lod-name\fR is omitted or '.',
then this rule does not affect the preferred parent of this symbol.
The file may contain blank lines or comment lines (lines whose first
non-whitespace character is '#').
.TP
\fB--force-branch\fR=\fIregexp\fR
Force symbols whose names match \fIregexp\fR to be branches.
\fIregexp\fR must match the whole symbol name.
.TP
\fB--force-tag\fR=\fIregexp\fR
Force symbols whose names match \fIregexp\fR to be tags.  \fIregexp\fR
must match the whole symbol name.
.TP
\fB--exclude\fR=\fIregexp\fR
Exclude branches and tags whose names match \fIregexp\fR from the
conversion.  \fIregexp\fR must match the whole symbol name.
.TP
\fB--symbol-default\fR=\fIopt\fR
Specify how to convert ambiguous symbols (those that appear in the CVS
archive as both branches and tags).  \fIopt\fR must be `branch' (treat
every ambiguous symbol as a branch), `tag' (treat every ambiguous
symbol as a tag), `heuristic' (decide how to treat each ambiguous
symbol based on whether it was used more often as a branch/tag in
CVS), or `strict' (no default; every ambiguous symbol has to be
resolved manually using \fB--force-branch\fR, \fB--force-tag\fR,
or \fB--exclude\fR).  The default is `strict'.
.TP
\fB--no-cross-branch-commits\fR
Prevent the creation of SVN commits that affect multiple branches or
trunk and a branch.  Instead, break such changesets into multiple
commits, one per branch.
.TP
\fB--retain-conflicting-attic-files\fR
If a file appears both inside an outside of the CVS attic, retain the
attic version in an SVN subdirectory called `Attic'.  (Normally this
situation is treated as a fatal error.)
.TP
\fB--username\fR=\fIname\fR
Set the default username to \fIname\fR when cvs2svn needs to generate
a commit for which CVS does not record the original username.  This
happens when a branch or tag is created.  The default is to use no
author at all for such commits.
.TP
\fB--cvs-revnums\fR
Record CVS revision numbers as file properties in the Subversion
repository.  (Note that unless it is removed explicitly, the last CVS
revision number will remain associated with the file even after the
file is changed within Subversion.)
.TP
\fB--mime-types\fR=\fIfile\fR
Specify an apache-style mime.types \fIfile\fR for setting
svn:mime-type.
.TP
\fB--eol-from-mime-type\fR
For files that don't have the kb expansion mode but have a known mime
type, set the eol-style based on the mime type.  For such files, set
svn:eol-style to "native" if the mime type begins with "text/", and
leave it unset (i.e., no EOL translation) otherwise.  Files with
unknown mime types are not affected by this option.  This option has
no effect unless the \fB--mime-types\fR option is also specified.
.TP
\fB--auto-props\fR=\fIfile\fR
Specify a file in the format of Subversion's config file, whose
[auto-props] section can be used to set arbitrary properties on files
in the Subversion repository based on their filenames.  (The
[auto-props] section header must be present; other sections of the
config file, including the enable-auto-props setting, are ignored.)
Filenames are matched to the filename patterns case-insensitively.
.TP
\fB--default-eol\fR=\fIstyle\fR
Set svn:eol-style to \fIstyle\fR for files that don't have the CVS
`kb' expansion mode and whose end-of-line translation mode hasn't been
determined by one of the other options.  \fIstyle\fR must be `binary'
(default), `native', `CRLF', `LF', or `CR'.
.TP
\fB--keywords-off\fR
By default, cvs2svn sets svn:keywords on CVS files to "author id date"
if the mode of the RCS file in question is either kv, kvl or unset.
If you use the --keywords-off switch, cvs2svn will not set
svn:keywords for any file.  While this will not touch the keywords in
the contents of your files, Subversion will not expand them.
.SH "EXTRACTION OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--use-internal-co\fR
Use internal code to extract revision contents.  This is up to 50%
faster than using \fB--use-rcs\fR, but needs a lot of disk space:
Roughly the size of your CVS repository plus the peak size of a
complete checkout of the repository with all branches that existed and
still had commits pending at a given time.  This option is the
default.
.TP
\fB--use-rcs\fR
Use RCS 'co' to extract revision contents.
.TP
\fB--use-cvs\fR
Use CVS to extract revision contents (only use this if having
problems with \fB--use-internal-co\fR or \fB--use-rcs\fR, as those
options are much faster).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--tmpdir\fR=\fIpath\fR
Set the \fIpath\fR to use for temporary data.  Default is a directory
called \fIcvs2svn-tmp\fR under the current directory.
.TP
\fB--svnadmin\fR=\fIpath\fR
Path to the \fIsvnadmin\fR program.  (\fIsvnadmin\fR is needed when
the \fB-s\fR/\fB--svnrepos\fR output option is used.)
.TP
\fB--co\fR=\fIpath\fR
Path to the \fIco\fR program.  (\fIco\fR is needed if the
\fB--use-rcs\fR option is used.)
.TP
\fB--cvs\fR=\fIpath\fR
Path to the \fIcvs\fR program.  (\fIcvs\fR is needed if the
\fB--use-cvs\fR option is used.)
.TP
\fB--sort\fR=\fIpath\fR
Path to the GNU \fIsort\fR program.  (cvs2svn requires GNU sort.)
.SH "PARTIAL CONVERSIONS"
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--pass\fR \fIpass\fR
Execute only pass \fIpass\fR of the conversion.  \fIpass\fR can be
specified by name or by number (see \fB--help-passes\fR).
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--passes\fR [\fIstart\fR]:[\fIend\fR]
Execute passes \fIstart\fR through \fIend\fR of the conversion
(inclusive).  \fIstart\fR and \fIend\fR can be specified by name or by
number (see \fB--help-passes\fR).  If \fIstart\fR or \fIend\fR is
missing, it defaults to the first or last pass, respectively.  For
this to work the earlier passes must have been completed before on the
same CVS repository, and the generated data files must be in the
temporary directory (see \fB--tmpdir\fR).
.SH "INFORMATION OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print the version number.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print the usage message and exit with success.
.TP
\fB--help-passes\fR
Print the numbers and names of the conversion passes and exit with
success.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Print more information while running.  This option may be specified
twice to output voluminous debugging information.
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Print less information while running.  This option may be specified
twice to suppress all non-error output.
.TP
\fB--write-symbol-info\fR=\fIpath\fR
Write symbol statistics and information about how symbols were
converted to \fIpath\fR during CollateSymbolsPass.
.TP
\fB--skip-cleanup\fR
Prevent the deletion of temporary files.
.TP
\fB--profile\fR
Profile with 'hotshot' (into file \fIcvs2svn.hotshot\fR).
.SH FILES
A directory called \fIcvs2svn-tmp\fR (or the directory specified by
\fB--tmpdir\fR) is used as scratch space for temporary data files.
